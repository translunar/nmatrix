* 4 major enhancements

  * NVector orientation is now controlled by its shape, not by the
    @orientation property

  * NVector default orientation is now a row vector rather than a
    column, as this is more efficient for Yale storage

  * NVector objects may now be created with dtypes other than dense

  * Exposure of additional ATLAS-implemented BLAS functions,
    including native rational and Ruby object support, for xANUM (sum
    of the absolute values of a vector) and xNRM2 (2-norm of a
    vector); and Ruby helper functions BLAS::anum and BLAS::nrm2
    which should do more careful argument sanity checking

* 9 minor enhancements

  * Added #yale_vector_insert to NMatrix::YaleFunctions, to speed up
    insertion of multiple items into a Yale matrix

  * Added #yale_nd_row, #yale_nd_row_as_hash, #yale_nd_row_as_array,
    #yale_nd_row_as_set, #yale_nd_row_as_sorted_set, #yale_row,
    #yale_row_as_hash, #yale_row_as_array, #yale_row_as_set,
    #yale_row_as_sorted_set, #yale_nd_row_size to
    NMatrix::YaleFunctions in order to speed up getting multiple
    items from some row of a Yale matrix

  * Improved #yale_ija, #yale_a, #yale_d by allowing an optional
    index argument, which returns a single array value instead of
    copying and returning the entire array

  * Improved sorting algorithm for Yale matrix multiplication;
    instead of selection sort, now uses quicksort; and subs in
    insertion sort for small partitions

  * Slicing a single row or column now returns an NVector instead
    of an NMatrix (does not yet work for n-dimensional matrices)

  * Improved function documentation for NVector and NMatrix

  * Added #min, #max, #to_a, #shuffle, #shuffle!, #absolute_sum,
    #norm2 functions to NVector

  * Aliased missing dimension of NVector#each_stored_with_indices to
    #each_stored_with_index, which only yields a value and i or j
    (not both i and j) depending on the vector orientation

  * Added #each_row, #each_column to NMatrix

* 5 bug fixes:

  * Dense iterators now return self (an NMatrix) in order to be
    consistent with Ruby Array behavior (by @cjfuller)

  * Fixed Yale resize problem (by @v0dro)

  * Fixed Yale nx1 times 1xn multiplication problem

    #each, #each_with_indices, #each_stored_with_indices

  * Added element-wise power function (**) for dense matrices (by
    @agarie)

  * Dramatically improved matrix element-wise and scalar functions so
    C++ templates are no longer necessary; element-wise operations
    may now be written in protected Ruby methods that look like
    NMatrix#__list_elementwise_op__ and NMatrix#__list_scalar_op__

  * Element-wise and scalar operations that might return a true or
    false now return Ruby matrices

  * Yale element-wise and scalar operations have been added

  * Yale is now allowed to have a non-zero default (specifically to
    permit true-false matrices and nil sparse bases)

  * Dramatically improved NMatrix#cast to allow for hashed options
    including a :default for list and yale casts

  * Dramatically improved speed of compilation

* 14 minor enhancements:

  * Improved documentation for exposed BLAS and LAPACK functions

  * Allowed for use of BLAS::rot without cloning x and y (in-place
    plane rotation); removed unnecessary test of unfriendly version

  * Added more user-friendly cblas_xrotg implementation: BLAS::rotg

  * Moved NMatrix::YaleFunctions::yale_vector_insert to
    NMatrix#__yale_vector_set__, which is more consistent with
    behavior

  * Changed notations for protected stype-specific functions, which
    now look like __stype_method_name__, e.g., __yale_vector_set__

  * Added NMatrix#__list_default_value__ protected function to get
    the initial (sparse) value for list matrices

  * Changed behavior and names of NMatrix::YaleFunctions methods
    which get column indices and cell contents by row, so that they
    now expect the :keys option (like Hash#keys) instead of :array,
    which doesn't make sense; name changes are as follows:
      yale_row_as_sorted_set -> yale_ja_d_keys_sorted_set_at
      yale_row_as_set -> yale_ja_d_keys_set_at
      yale_row_as_array -> yale_ja_d_keys_at
      yale_nd_row_as_sorted_set -> yale_ja_sorted_set_at
      yale_nd_row_as_set -> yale_ja_set_at
      yale_nd_row_as_array -> yale_ja_at
    Aliases are included but will be removed without notice.

  * Added NVector#sorted_indices and #binned_sorted_indices for use
    when running k-nearest neighbor searches on a distance matrix

  * Added NVector::logspace shortcut function (analogous to
    NVector::linspace)

  * Cleaned up code by removing monkey patches that we stopped using
    circa v0.0.2 (Array#min, Array#max, String#constantize,
    String#camelize, String#underscore)

  * Re-enabled element-wise mod (%) method

  * Added NMatrix::guess_dtype class method, which allows you to
    figure out what dtype (roughly) should be used for any given
    Ruby value (e.g., 3)

  * String and nil objects in NMatrix cells are no longer outlawed
    (but are not supported), provided they are of the :object dtype

  * NMatrix#diag shortcut for specifying sparse matrix with a user-
    specified diagonal array (by @ryanmt)

* 3 bug fixes:

  * Corrected BLAS::rot bounds checking on optional n argument

  * Removed BLAS::rotg and BLAS::nrm2 code for rational numbers, as
    both involve a square root

  * Repaired list matrix element-wise functions

=== 0.0.7 / 2013-08-22

* 6 major enhancements:

  * Eliminated NVector in favor of NMatrix objects with
    #effective_dim smaller than #dim; added NVector-like
    functionality to NMatrix, sometimes with #respond_to? dependent
    upon matrix dimensions; allowed for NVector.new to continue
    to function as before, but now returns an NMatrix instead

  * Began major re-factoring of headers for math.cpp

  * Added two singular value decomposition functions for dense
    NMatrix objects, #gesvd and #gesdd, for floating point and
    complex dtypes

  * Added additional slicing shorthand, which uses hashes (e.g.,
    n[0=>3,2] for n[0..3,2]), which may eventually allow users to use
    n[0:3,2] notation instead (needs Ruby core patch)

  * #[] and #[]= calls no longer need index on those matrix shape
    elements which are equal to 1 (e.g., vectors)

  * Yale slicing-by-reference has been added

* 18 minor enhancements:

  * Added user-friendly NMatrix::LAPACK::laswp method

  * Added NMatrix#permute_columns! and NMatrix#permute_columns

  * Added NMatrix#abs to compute element-wise absolute values, and
    #abs_dtype to determine the dtype returned by a call to #abs on a
    given matrix (needed for RSpec)

  * Added NMatrix#size to compute the total number of cells in an
    NMatrix object (solely accounting for the shape, not sparsity)

  * Added RSpec monkey patches for #be_within to work with NMatrix
    objects; usable by requiring "nmatrix/rspec"

  * Added experimental NMatrix::LAPACK::lapack_gesvd function (which
    does NOT depend upon CLAPACK) (by @ryanmt and @mohawkjohn)

  * Added experimental non-LAPACK-dependent function
    NMatrix::LAPACK::lapack_gesdd

  * Added NMatrix#supershape method for getting the shape of a
    slice's parent or other ancestor, which may be useful for calling
    ATLAS and LAPACK functions on slices

  * Aliased NMatrix[] to function like N[] shortcut for matrix
    creation (by @agarie)

  * Added #layer for matrices with dimension greater than two
    (corresponds to #row and #column)

  * Added #rank and #each_rank generics for #row/#column/#layer and
    #each_row/#each_column/#each_layer respectively (#each_rank
    replaces #each_along_dim)

  * Replaced #reduce_along_dim with #inject_rank

  * NMatrix#to_a now works for up to two dimensional matrices; and
    returns a flattened array for single-row matrices

  * NMatrix#to_flat_a now returns a flattened array of all entries

  * Re-organized NMatrix Ruby sources into multiple files: math.rb
    for instance methods which are mathematical in nature or are
    essentially ATLAS/LAPACK/BLAS calls, enumerate.rb for methods
    involving enumeration; and existing shortcuts.rb for convenience
    functions and shortcut constructors, and nmatrix.rb for core
    functionality (#inspect, #to_h, #to_a, #to_s, #pretty_print,
    and so on)

  * Improved #pretty_print, which now also prints layers (the third
    dimension in a 3D matrix)

  * Re-factored some of dense slicing to remove some redundant code

  * Added shortcut functions #list?, #dense?, #yale? for quickly
    testing matrix storage type

    dense cast, or accepts an array or single value)

  * Re-factored Yale into a more object-oriented and less confusing
    set of header files

  * Enabled Travis CI (by @cjfuller)

* 4 minor enhancements:

  * Renamed some specs in order to change their test order, so that
    critical tests fail first (particularly in the case of

    value option

=== 0.1.0.rc1 / 2013-12-28

* 4 major enhancements:

  * Improved garbage collection strategy for partial object creation
    (i.e., when VALUEs are allocated but not registered right away),
    which in addition to fixing numerous bugs should prevent some new
    bugs from arising in the future (by @cjfuller)

  * Implemented list storage transpose

  * Implemented generic n-dimensional transpose

  * Implemented == comparison between differing matrix stypes

  * Added GCC installation instructions for Mac OS X Mavericks, and
    updated the old installation instructions for Mac OS X (both
    found in scripts/)
