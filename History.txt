* 4 major enhancements

  * NVector orientation is now controlled by its shape, not by the
    @orientation property

  * NVector default orientation is now a row vector rather than a
    column, as this is more efficient for Yale storage

  * NVector objects may now be created with dtypes other than dense

  * Exposure of additional ATLAS-implemented BLAS functions,
    including native rational and Ruby object support, for xANUM (sum
    of the absolute values of a vector) and xNRM2 (2-norm of a
    vector); and Ruby helper functions BLAS::anum and BLAS::nrm2
    which should do more careful argument sanity checking

* 9 minor enhancements

  * Added #yale_vector_insert to NMatrix::YaleFunctions, to speed up
    insertion of multiple items into a Yale matrix

  * Added #yale_nd_row, #yale_nd_row_as_hash, #yale_nd_row_as_array,
    #yale_nd_row_as_set, #yale_nd_row_as_sorted_set, #yale_row,

    #yale_row_as_sorted_set, #yale_nd_row_size to
    NMatrix::YaleFunctions in order to speed up getting multiple
    items from some row of a Yale matrix

  * Improved #yale_ija, #yale_a, #yale_d by allowing an optional
    index argument, which returns a single array value instead of
    copying and returning the entire array

  * Improved sorting algorithm for Yale matrix multiplication;
    instead of selection sort, now uses quicksort; and subs in
    insertion sort for small partitions

  * Slicing a single row or column now returns an NVector instead
    of an NMatrix (does not yet work for n-dimensional matrices)

  * Improved function documentation for NVector and NMatrix

  * Added #min, #max, #to_a, #shuffle, #shuffle!, #absolute_sum,
    #norm2 functions to NVector

  * Aliased missing dimension of NVector#each_stored_with_indices to
    #each_stored_with_index, which only yields a value and i or j
    (not both i and j) depending on the vector orientation

    #each, #each_with_indices, #each_stored_with_indices

  * Added element-wise power function (**) for dense matrices (by
    @agarie)

  * Dramatically improved matrix element-wise and scalar functions so
    C++ templates are no longer necessary; element-wise operations
    may now be written in protected Ruby methods that look like
    NMatrix#__list_elementwise_op__ and NMatrix#__list_scalar_op__

  * Element-wise and scalar operations that might return a true or
    false now return Ruby matrices

  * Yale element-wise and scalar operations have been added

  * Yale is now allowed to have a non-zero default (specifically to
    permit true-false matrices and nil sparse bases)

  * Dramatically improved NMatrix#cast to allow for hashed options
    including a :default for list and yale casts

  * Dramatically improved speed of compilation

* 14 minor enhancements:

  * Improved documentation for exposed BLAS and LAPACK functions

  * Allowed for use of BLAS::rot without cloning x and y (in-place
    plane rotation); removed unnecessary test of unfriendly version

  * Added more user-friendly cblas_xrotg implementation: BLAS::rotg

  * Moved NMatrix::YaleFunctions::yale_vector_insert to
    NMatrix#__yale_vector_set__, which is more consistent with
    behavior

  * Changed notations for protected stype-specific functions, which
    now look like __stype_method_name__, e.g., __yale_vector_set__

  * Added NMatrix#__list_default_value__ protected function to get
    the initial (sparse) value for list matrices

  * Changed behavior and names of NMatrix::YaleFunctions methods
    which get column indices and cell contents by row, so that they
    now expect the :keys option (like Hash#keys) instead of :array,
    which doesn't make sense; name changes are as follows:
      yale_row_as_sorted_set -> yale_ja_d_keys_sorted_set_at
      yale_row_as_set -> yale_ja_d_keys_set_at
      yale_row_as_array -> yale_ja_d_keys_at
      yale_nd_row_as_sorted_set -> yale_ja_sorted_set_at
      yale_nd_row_as_set -> yale_ja_set_at
      yale_nd_row_as_array -> yale_ja_at
    Aliases are included but will be removed without notice.

  * Added NVector#sorted_indices and #binned_sorted_indices for use
    when running k-nearest neighbor searches on a distance matrix

  * Added NVector::logspace shortcut function (analogous to
    NVector::linspace)

    circa v0.0.2 (Array#min, Array#max, String#constantize,
    String#camelize, String#underscore)

  * Re-enabled element-wise mod (%) method

  * Added NMatrix::guess_dtype class method, which allows you to
    figure out what dtype (roughly) should be used for any given
    Ruby value (e.g., 3)

  * String and nil objects in NMatrix cells are no longer outlawed
    (but are not supported), provided they are of the :object dtype

  * NMatrix#diag shortcut for specifying sparse matrix with a user-
    specified diagonal array (by @ryanmt)

* 3 bug fixes:

  * Corrected BLAS::rot bounds checking on optional n argument

  * Removed BLAS::rotg and BLAS::nrm2 code for rational numbers, as
    both involve a square root

  * Repaired list matrix element-wise functions

=== 0.0.7 / 2013-08-22

* 6 major enhancements:

  * Eliminated NVector in favor of NMatrix objects with
    #effective_dim smaller than #dim; added NVector-like
    functionality to NMatrix, sometimes with #respond_to? dependent
    upon matrix dimensions; allowed for NVector.new to continue
    to function as before, but now returns an NMatrix instead

  * Began major re-factoring of headers for math.cpp

  * Added two singular value decomposition functions for dense
    NMatrix objects, #gesvd and #gesdd, for floating point and
    complex dtypes

  * Added additional slicing shorthand, which uses hashes (e.g.,
    n[0=>3,2] for n[0..3,2]), which may eventually allow users to use
    n[0:3,2] notation instead (needs Ruby core patch)

  * #[] and #[]= calls no longer need index on those matrix shape
    elements which are equal to 1 (e.g., vectors)

* 18 minor enhancements:

  * Added user-friendly NMatrix::LAPACK::laswp method

  * Added NMatrix#permute_columns! and NMatrix#permute_columns

    #abs_dtype to determine the dtype returned by a call to #abs on a
    given matrix (needed for RSpec)

  * Added NMatrix#size to compute the total number of cells in an
    NMatrix object (solely accounting for the shape, not sparsity)

  * Added RSpec monkey patches for #be_within to work with NMatrix
    objects; usable by requiring "nmatrix/rspec"

  * Added experimental NMatrix::LAPACK::lapack_gesvd function (which
    does NOT depend upon CLAPACK) (by @ryanmt and @mohawkjohn)

  * Added experimental non-LAPACK-dependent function
    NMatrix::LAPACK::lapack_gesdd

  * Added NMatrix#supershape method for getting the shape of a
    slice's parent or other ancestor, which may be useful for calling
    ATLAS and LAPACK functions on slices

  * Aliased NMatrix[] to function like N[] shortcut for matrix
    creation (by @agarie)

  * Added #layer for matrices with dimension greater than two
    (corresponds to #row and #column)

    #each_row/#each_column/#each_layer respectively (#each_rank
    replaces #each_along_dim)

  * Replaced #reduce_along_dim with #inject_rank

  * NMatrix#to_a now works for up to two dimensional matrices; and
    returns a flattened array for single-row matrices

  * NMatrix#to_flat_a now returns a flattened array of all entries

  * Re-organized NMatrix Ruby sources into multiple files: math.rb
    for instance methods which are mathematical in nature or are
    essentially ATLAS/LAPACK/BLAS calls, enumerate.rb for methods
    involving enumeration; and existing shortcuts.rb for convenience
    functions and shortcut constructors, and nmatrix.rb for core
    functionality (#inspect, #to_h, #to_a, #to_s, #pretty_print,
    and so on)

  * Improved #pretty_print, which now also prints layers (the third
    dimension in a 3D matrix)

  * Added shortcut functions #list?, #dense?, #yale? for quickly
    testing matrix storage type
